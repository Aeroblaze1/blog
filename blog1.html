    <p>Indonesia is raw, uncharted travel at its best. This group of 17,000 islands is largely unexplored by tourists and it has everything you could want in an adventure: volcanoes, waterfalls, jungles, underwater coral reefs, and lots of unique wildlife above and below the sea.

        The most famous destination in Indonesia is the island of Bali, with its green rice paddies, luxury resorts, and local cuisine, but there are some other interesting places in Indonesia too. The islands of Komodo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi are great places for seeing exotic wildlife, while less known Sumba has white sand beaches and rolling green hills.
        
        Java, the most populated island, has some incredible volcanic landscapes and ancient Hindu temples like Prambanan and Borobudur. Read through this complete Indonesia travel guide for more info on what to expect!</p>
